###Approach
- approach 1: **two prointers**
<br />
Since the array is sorted, we can keep two pointers(here are i and length),
we denote i as the counter and length as a pointer to the last element of the
array in which each element appears only once.
<br />
remember to do length + 1 while return the result.
