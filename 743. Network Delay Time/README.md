###Approach 1: Dijkstra###
  
  use Dijkstra to find the shortest path to every vertex, and find the maximum. The maximum is the result. We first try to construct the graph. using the map and the list, the key is the source and the value is the list, each contains the target and the weight. Then, implement the Dijkstra. As the number of the vertex is not sure, We use a map instead of an array to store the Label of each vertex.
