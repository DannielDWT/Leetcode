**Approach 1: binary search**
    use binary search to find the element which is the maximuma among the array where each element is less than the target.
    It is easy to write the standard binary search (I mean that to find the target in the given sorted array), but sometimes it is a little difficult for me to find the element less or larger than the target.
    I try to change the target, that means my target is the element that may be less or larger than the "target". And I treat the array as closed interval ([left, right]).
    You can see the code in the ***Solution***.

**Approach 2: Linear Search**
