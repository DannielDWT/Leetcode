### approach 1: **two pointers**
  It is an easy problem. using 'two pointers' method, we keep two pointers i and length, where length is slow-runner and i is fast-runner.
### approch 2: **two pointers(in leetcode)**
  this method is given in the solution in leetcode.
>Now consider cases where the array contains few elements to remove. For example, nums = >[1,2,3,5,4], val = 4nums=[1,2,3,5,4],val=4. The previous algorithm will do unnecessary copy >operation of the first four elements. Another example is nums = [4,1,2,3,5], val = >4nums=[4,1,2,3,5],val=4. It seems unnecessary to move elements [1,2,3,5][1,2,3,5] one step left >as the problem description mentions that the order of elements could be changed.
